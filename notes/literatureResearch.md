## Using "CBR fault detection" as search words in ieeeXplore

### Adaptive Maintenance Knowledge Bases for Field Service
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4161647/
- Maintenance Knowledge Base(MKB), an information system capable of offering solutions to diagnostic problems at a level comparable to experts
- The paper presents a solution that "seamlessly combines model-based reasoning (MBR) and CBR for adaptive knowledge base creation, maintenance and update through multi-signal flow graph modeling.
- The solution combines the prior knowledge with the posterior knowledge using a Bayesian framework.
- Reduces the upfront cost in creating the diagnostic model, but also the barrier of entry for system fault detection and diagnosis(FDD)

### A case-based reasoning approach to the management of faults in communications networks
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/366653/
- Old, from 1993
- Most systems for FDD are rule-based reasoning(RBR), these systems have no learning to them
- The paper enhances a standard fault management system with a CBR component.
- It reviews retrieving, adapting and retaining, and CRITTER a CBR trouble ticketing system for managing and resolving network faults.

### Using the Case-Based Ranking Methodology for Test Case Prioritization
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4021329/
- Prioritizing test cses to optimize the achievement of the testing goal, test the cases most likely to be faulty first
- Case-based ranking (CBR), elicits just relative priority information from the user, comparisons
- User inputs(cases or just the queries?) are integrated with multiple prioritization indexes.
- Results on a case study indicate that the CBR overcomes previous approaches, and can get close to the optimal solution

### Multiway Principal Component Analysis and Case Base Reasoning methodology for abnormal situation detection in a nutrient removing SBR
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7068413/
- Multiway Principal Component Analysis(MPCA) and CBR are applied in a biological nutrient removal process(removal of unwanted/over represented nutrients from water).
- CBR was used to find similar solutions under normal/abnormal situations: low ORP, high pH.
- Several proof are made in the paper

### Expert supervision based on cases
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996399/
- Take advantage of data stored in SCADA systems(used in processing plants/factories)
- Using a CBR system to perform export supervisory tasks in a dynamic system
- Focuses on proposing a general case definition suitable for supervisory tasks
- Is tested on a real drier chamber  

### Case-Based Reasoning in the Plenary Diagnostic Environment
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4062447/
- CBR on multi-level(Plenary) diagnostic environment: the fault can be on different levels, in manifacturing it can be on a car, the facility or the personel

### Fault diagnosis method for complex equipment using CBR
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6852276/
- FDD on complex equipment to increase reliability and decrease possible loss
- Uses CBR to infer and classify various failures
- Case retrieval based on the improved grey relational analysis
- CBR based FDD-system applied to diesel engine

### Fault detection using topological case based modelimg and its application to chiller performance deterioration
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/352030/
- Topological Case Based Modeling (TCBM) as FDD
- Continuous input/output relation, possible to describe nonlinear systems
- CBR inferes from stored cases and these relation
- Example of TCBM to detect deterioration for a chiller system

### Focusing fault localization in model-based diagnosis with case-based reasoning
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7068686/
- Consistency-based diagnosis automatically provides fault detection and localization capabilities, using just models for correct behavior, but lacks discrimination power.
- Studies Consistency-based diagnosis system together with CBR systems
- CBR system provides accurate indication of most probable fault in the early process of the Consistency-based diagnosis system


### Case-base reasoning in vehicle fault diagnostics
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1223990/
- CBR as FDD in vehicles
- Distributed diagnostic agent system (DDAS) as FDD using signal analysis and ML
- CBR used to find root faults in vehicles, based the DDAS. Two CBR methods used, one uses direct sensor data, another the signal segment features
- Experiments conducted on real vehicles

### A case-based reasoning approach for fault detection state in bridges assessment
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4588730/
- CBR as FDD of reinforced concrete bridges on polluted areas.
- Earlier FDD uses fuzzy models and neural networks, this uses CBR, might have a comparison
- Uses jCOLIBRI

### A Case-based Reasoning with Feature Weights Derived by BP Network
url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4426957/
- Investigates the performance of a hybrid case-based reasoning method, integrading a multi-layer BP NN with CBR algorithms for dericatives feature weights
- The BP NN obtains attribute weights, CBR classifies
- Studies different parameters to test performance
- Got better results using the hybrid method then CBR alone
